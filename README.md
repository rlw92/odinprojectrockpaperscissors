# odinprojectrockpaperscissors
A project that I am creating for the Odin project that is a rock paper scissors game consisting of five rounds played against the computer.

**

My current objective is to make a user interface based in the webpage for the player to use instead of going inside the console.
It should consist of:

*Big block buttons to press to choose one of the three options
*Scores on each side of me and the computer
*CHanging text for whatever the final outcome is  after five round.


When I go for a more advanced iteration to put into my portfolio I am hoping to  include:

*A brief animated introduction of a rogue program challenging the user to a game of RPS
*Scary looking computer face that changes depending on if he wins a round or wins the game or loses etc
*Animation of a screen going black if the player loses and a game over animation
